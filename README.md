**Disaggregation protocol for the SURIMI project**

For the disaggregation process, we need to have the number of vessels by length and gear for each port. Furthermore, the data are often at different levels of cleanliness and precision depending on the GSA of reference.

In this procedure we show two Case Studies (CS):
- The first one (CS-GSA6) presents the simplest situation: we only need to disaggregate prices per port - we already have data on the number of boats and the source dataset includes all data, accurate and clean, for all gears.
- The second case (CS GSA9) is the most complicated situation: we do not have the data for the number of boats, which we will extrapolate with the Global Fishing Watch dataset, and the source landings data are inaccurate, some values are outliers and not all years are covered.
